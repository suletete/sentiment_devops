## File Descriptions
1. `docker_sentiment_analysis_model_env.yaml`: Copy of the `sentiment_analysis_model_env.yaml` in the directory above, but this one is slimmed down to just the packages needed to actually run the application.
2. `requirements.txt`: All of the packages/dependencies needed to run the application in a Docker container. This file is used when creating a Docker image from the `Dockerfile` in the directory above. This helps decrease the size of the Docker image.
